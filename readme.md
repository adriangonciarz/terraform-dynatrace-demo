## Whats the clinic all about?
Dynatraceâ€™s Terraform Provider brings Observability as Code for Terraform, one of the leading Infrastructure as Code solutions. #Dynatrace Terraform Provider enables self-service observability for developers, DevOps, SRE, and Platform Engineering by automating the management of SLOs, Dashboards, Synthetic Checks, Anomaly Detection, Alerting, Management Zones, and more.

For this Observability Clinic, we invited Adrian Gonciarz, SRE Director at Kitopi, who worked closely with the open source development team to ensure the Dynatrace Terraform Provider fulfills all requirements of modern SRE and Cloud Native teams. Watch Adrian as he shares best practices, getting started tips, and an amazing live demo, including multi-environment delivery of his demo AWS Lambda functions, including full Dynatrace configuration of SLOs, Dashboards, and Synthetic Tests.
